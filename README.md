# projectBike
As a biker I would like to know the exact location of city bikes around the world in a given application.
•             Endpoint: http://api.citybik.es/v2/networks
•             Auth: No
•             HTTPS: No
•             Understands how the API works.
•             Create some BDD scenarios and automate them using Java to test the API
•             Test this particular scenario: “As a user I want to verify that the city Frankfurt is in Germany and return their corresponded latitude and longitude”



.   I investigate APIs and generate POJO classes to map responses as an object.
.   I create a CityBikeService to use in step definitions.
•   My framework is Cucumber (BDD). 
•	I built my framework using Java Programming Language.
•	I used maven as a build automation tool for my java project.
•	I used cucumber-junit and Cucumber runner to orchestrate tests.
.   Inside the Cucumber runner, I used glues in order to connect feature files to step definitions.
.   I added report plugin to Cucumber Runner to generate Json and html report.
•	I have utilities package, which contains utility classes such as ConfigUtils and DBUtils.
•	I am using Cucumber and Gherkin language in order non-technical people to understand what is going on in testing.
.   I used Cucumber Datatable feature to verify Location object. 
•	I have created my test cases in the feature files as is.
•	In Feature folder I store my feature files separately, it helps in usability of the codes.
•	I use Initialize as pre- and post-test implementations.
•	Step Definitions folder is the place where my actual test scripts are.
•	For assertions / verifications, to compare expected and actual results I utilize Hamcrest Matcher.
.   I also use tags for tests that I want to run in bulk.
•	My framework is completely easy to maintain.
